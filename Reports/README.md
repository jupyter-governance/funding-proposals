Welcome! This repository is used to track progress updates for all community-funded proposals approved by the Jupyter Foundation Governing Board.

To keep things simple and transparent, reporting happens directly in GitHub using a lightweight Markdown template and a pull request workflow.

This process is intentionally designed to be minimally time-consuming for both award recipients and reviewers.

## REPO Structure

Each award has its own dedicated folder. \
Each folder contains:

* A reusable **report-template.md**
* A series of bi-monthly reports submitted via PRs

## Reporting Schedule

Reports are required every other month for the duration of the funded work. Due on the second to last Thursday of the month. 

PMO will send a reminder a week before each reporting month

## How to Submit Your Report

1. Copy the file named: report-template.md
2. Create a new file named: YYYY-MM-report.md Example: 2025-02-report.md
3. Fill in the template.
4. Submit a Pull Request titled: [Report] Award Title – YYYY-MM
5. We will review and merge your PR.

All reporting happens publicly in GitHub to ensure transparency and a consistent record of progress.

## Questions or Support

If you need help with the template, reporting cadence, or the GitHub workflow, open an issue or contact the PMO team.
